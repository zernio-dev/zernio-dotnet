# Late.Model.TikTokPlatformData
Photo carousels up to 35 images. Video titles up to 2200 chars, photo titles truncated to 90 chars. privacyLevel must match creator_info options. Both camelCase and snake_case accepted.  Creator Inbox (draft mode): Set draft: true to send content to the TikTok Creator Inbox instead of publishing immediately. The creator receives an inbox notification and completes the post using TikTok's editing flow. This maps to TikTok's post_mode: \"MEDIA_UPLOAD\" internally.  Important: The field publish_type is NOT supported. Use draft: true for Creator Inbox flow.  Photo drafts use the /v2/post/publish/content/init/ endpoint with post_mode: \"MEDIA_UPLOAD\". Video drafts use the dedicated /v2/post/publish/inbox/video/init/ endpoint.  When draft: true, the video.upload scope is required. When draft is false or omitted (direct post), the video.publish scope is required. For Creator Inbox, TikTok app version must be 31.8 or higher.
