**FirstComment** | **string** | Optional first comment to post immediately after publishing, as a reply to the published post. With threadItems, it replies to the root post. Up to 500 characters (the Threads post limit). The reply is itself a Threads post, so it consumes one of the 250 posts a profile may publish per 24 hours. | [optional] 
**ThreadItems** | [**List&lt;TwitterPlatformDataThreadItemsInner&gt;**](TwitterPlatformDataThreadItemsInner.md) | Complete sequence of posts in a Threads thread.
