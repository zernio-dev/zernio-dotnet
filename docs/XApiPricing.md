# Zernio.Model.XApiPricing
Canonical X API pricing table. Zernio passes X API costs through at exact rates with zero markup, so every call you make has a known per-unit price. Use this payload alongside `/v1/usage-stats` (which returns per-operation call counts via `xApiCallsByOperation`) to compute exact cost attribution by X action.
