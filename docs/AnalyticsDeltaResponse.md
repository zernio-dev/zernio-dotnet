# Zernio.Model.AnalyticsDeltaResponse

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**Data** | [**List&lt;AnalyticsDeltaEntry&gt;**](AnalyticsDeltaEntry.md) | Changed snapshots, oldest first, in the order the feed received them. Empty on the bootstrap call (no &#x60;cursor&#x60; supplied) and whenever nothing has changed since your cursor.  | 
**NextCursor** | **string** | Cursor to send on the next call. ALWAYS present, including on an empty page, so you always have something to advance with, and it never moves backwards. Opaque: pass it back verbatim, and do not parse, construct or compare cursors.  | 
**HasMore** | **bool** | True when more changes are already waiting past &#x60;nextCursor&#x60;, so call again immediately. False means you are caught up: keep &#x60;nextCursor&#x60; and poll again later. This feed never ends, so &#x60;hasMore: false&#x60; does NOT mean &#x60;nextCursor&#x60; is null.  |
