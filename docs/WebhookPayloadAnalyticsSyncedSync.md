# Zernio.Model.WebhookPayloadAnalyticsSyncedSync
Summary of the analytics sync cycle that just completed.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**SyncedAt** | **DateTime** | When the cycle COMPLETED. Not a join key for the delta feed: the rows a cycle produces carry a &#x60;syncedAt&#x60; stamped when the cycle STARTED, which is measured at around one second earlier at the median and up to a couple of minutes earlier in the tail. Correlate on &#x60;account.accountId&#x60;.  | 
**PostsUpdated** | **int** | Post records created or modified by this cycle. Not the number of delta feed rows the cycle produced, which the syncer does not report, so a cycle with a non-zero &#x60;postsUpdated&#x60; can still yield an empty delta page.  |
